# CODSOFT
These are the task provided by codsoft under Datascience Internship.
1. Titanic_Survival -
     Exploring Learning Curves with the Titanic Dataset. As part of my internship at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to delve deep into the fascinating world of machine learning and model evaluation. One of the key tasks I worked on was generating and analyzing learning curves for a logistic regression model using the Titanic dataset. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the learning curves I generated:
These learning curves provide a comprehensive view of how our logistic regression model performs as we vary the size of the training dataset. They are crucial for identifying the right balance between bias and variance, ensuring our model generalizes well to unseen data.
2. Sales_Prediction-
     Data analysis and machine learning project where I predicted sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, radio, and newspapers. Visualized actual vs. predicted sales with scatter plots, demonstrating the model's accuracy.
3. Iris_Prediction -
      Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
Employed Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, including count plots and correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships and class distributions. Created a scatter plot to compare actual data points against the model's predictions, providing a clear visual representation of the model's effectiveness.


These project were not only a great way to hone my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning but also a reminder of how powerful and insightful data science can be.
